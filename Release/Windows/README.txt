When you run the program, your system is likely to lag. You will receive several .txt files, with the most important file being "infinite_merge.txt". The program starts as many threads as the system allows, so each thread represents an "infinite typing monkey", each "monkey" writing to its own file. These files are then merged together afterwards.

You can close the app when the console displays something similar to what's shown in the screenshot. If you don't close it, the "monkeys" will continue typing.
